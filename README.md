# Imap5harts
Imap5hartsJunk_3.py is the main file for processing Junk and Newsletters in my mailfile.
It both deletes Junk email as well as move likely Junk to two IMAP folders : Junk High Spam and Junk-Likely
The script also cleans up yesterday's daily newsletters so that the mail file doesn't get clogged up.

Imap5hartsJunk_write is a working file to attempt to identify new junk - either TLDs or frequent words, particularly in a different language e.g. para
It is very rough and is not yet delivering much value.
